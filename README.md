# labReact

This repository contains studies and exercises from my React learning.
The labs folder contains some test labs and u-training contains some applications created during an intensive React training.
The only thing needed to run these projects is Node.js, so to run them, download the code, navigate to any application folder and run the following commands.

```bash
npm install
```
This command will install the application dependencies.

```bash
npm start
```
This command will install and run a local server for the application.
